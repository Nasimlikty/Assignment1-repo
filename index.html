            <p>By choosing healthy over skinny, you are choosing self-love over self-judgement....Cooking is at once
                child’s play and adult joy. And cooking done with care is an act of love. Let food be thy medicine and
                medicine be thy food</p>

            “Cooking is like painting or writing a song. Just as there are only so many notes or colors, there are only
            so many flavors—it’s how you combine them that sets you apart.” “Cooking with kids is not just about
            ingredients, recipes, and cooking. It’s about harnessing imagination, empowerment, and creativity.”
